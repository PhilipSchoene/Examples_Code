========
Markdown
========

If you enter a comment, this is just plain text at first.  However, JuliaBase
supports a special syntax in these comments.  This makes them more useful.

This special syntax was not invented for JuliaBase.  Instead, it is a well-known
markup syntax called “`Markdown <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/markdown>`_”.
See also its `homepage <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics>`_
for the full story.  However, for practical reasons, JuliaBase forbids image
inclusion and headings in its comments.  But you can use all the rest.  Note
that some characters (e.g. »_«, »\*«, »[«) have a special meaning, so if you
want to use them as-is, you have to prepend a backslash »\\«.

JuliaBase even adds a nice feature itself: If you enter the name of a sample or a
sample series, JuliaBase converts it to a clickable link automatically.  Within
names, prepending a backslash to »_« is not necessary.

If you like to test JuliaBase's comment syntax, visit the `Markdown sandbox
<https://demo.juliabase.org/markdown>`_ on the demo site.


Paragraphs
==========

Paragraphs are separated by an empty line:

.. code-block:: none

    First paragraph.

    Second paragraph.

Output:

    First paragraph.

    Second paragraph.


Emphasis
========

.. code-block:: none

    *italics*, **bold**.  Alternatively:  _italics_, __bold__

..

    *italics*, **bold**.  Alternatively: *italics*, **bold**


Escaping characters
===================

If you like to use a character as-is but Markdown interprets it as something
special, put a backslash before it:

.. code-block:: none

    In *italics*, and this is not in \*italics\*.

..

    In *italics*, and this is not in \*italics\*.

Note that this is not necessary in sample names.  For example, in
“08B-410_a_3”, nothing gets italic (if this sample exists).


Special characters
==================

.. code-block:: none

    &sigma; = e n &mu;
    &micro;c-Si:H

..

    | σ = e n μ
    | µc-Si:H

See the `Wikipedia entry
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_XML_and_HTML_character_entity_references>`_
for a full list of these characters.


.. index:: maths, equations, formulae

Math equations
==============

You can use LaTeX equations between $...$:

.. code-block:: none

    $\alpha = \frac{1}{\beta}$

..

    :math:`\alpha = \frac{1}{\beta}`


Links
=====

.. code-block:: none

    [Homepage of IBM](http://www.ibm.com), <http://www.fz-juelich.de>

..

    `Homepage of IBM <http://www.ibm.com>`_, http://www.fz-juelich.de

Note that names of samples and sample series are converted to links
automatically.


Lists
=====

.. code-block:: none

    1. sputtering
    2. etching
    3. depositing

..

    1. sputtering
    2. etching
    3. depositing

Yes, that's not the same!  ``;-)`` For long lines, indentation is correct this
way.

.. code-block:: none

    * this
    * that
    * and this, too

..

    * this
    * that
    * and this, too


Line breaks
===========

Put two spaces at the end of the line:

.. code-block:: none

    First line.<SPC><SPC>
    Second line.

..

    | First line.
    | Second line.
