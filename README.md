# Examples_Code
Here are some exmaples of what I have coded. There is a very big project that I have coded for Fraunhofer. As well as single files that have helped me learn in my studies.

Programmed the database on top of the Juliabase framework from the Research Center in Julich. I was the single programmer for this project at Fraunhofer IISB, realizing the requests of the experimentalists. 
Coded remotley on a server in Erlangen (headquarter of Fraunhofer IISB). Created a web-based database for sharing and storing all measurements. This was integrated into the workflow at the IISB. 
Shortly after, the Insitute of Applied Physics at TU Freiberg also declared their interest. To align with Fraunhofer data security rules, I could not simply copy my code from the server.   
After assurance with my supervisors, I adapted the code, put it into a virtual machine, turned this  into an Apache server, and set it up at the Institute of Applied Physics. 
The Virutal Machine (.ova, VirtualBox) can be downloaded with this link https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QE-fswj190EfQ93f6YNvX4w7YyPJWeiK/view?usp=sharing
