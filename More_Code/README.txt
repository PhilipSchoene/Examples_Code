This folder contains code, that helped me get more familiar with slected topics in physics. 
It is all Python (iPython notebooks). 

For my work in HPC, I mostly used Slurm to manage the  nodes, this is not really coding. For Quantum Chemistry we did not have to start from scratch (Methods in Bachelor thesis) and use the already optmized ORCA (C++/C). But what had be done is extracting information from the obtained results and viualizing it, this was also done with Python. I included an example, neb_snapshots.py.
